# Awesome profile-cards

The project consists of creating a web application that allows us to create a personalized business card. On the website, we can enter our professional data and obtain a formatted view with this information.

The Adalab Web Starter Kit (AWSK) has been used, which includes an HTML template engine, SASS preprocessor, and a local server. Node JS needs to be installed to work with the project.

It is important to note that the `public/` and `docs/` folders are automatically generated when the project is started. The Kit reads the files inside `src/`, processes them, and generates them inside `public/` and `docs/`.

### Technologies used:

- Advanced use of HTML forms.
- Layout using advanced CSS such as flex and grid.
- Use of media queries to make the design adaptable to the device using the mobile-first strategy.
- Handling events in the browser.
- Accessing and sending data to a server.
- Local storage using LocalStorage.
- Using Git for project version control.
- Publishing the result on the Internet using GitHub Pages.
- Use of APIs.

### Website details:

- A welcome landing page.
- A page for the card-making application that allows the user to:

    1. Choose the card style, and also choose a color palette.

    2. By entering information into a form, the text is automatically formatted and displayed in a box similar to a business card, which will be the preview of the final result.

    3. Allow the user to create a website with their card and share it on Twitter.
    
**The business card must have the following fields** 

- Full name
- Profession

Personal information
- Phone 
- Email 

Social media
- LinkedIn 
- GitHub 

**Regarding the interaction with the web:**

- The fields must have restrictions for their indicated format. Phone field for mobile, email for email, etc.
- The modifications we make in the form (design and content), appear automatically in the preview of the card.
- The 3 parts of the creation process will be collapsible elements, which, when clicking on the title, will show/hide, only displaying one section at a time.
- All the information from the form must be stored in LocalStorage (browser local storage), so that when reloading the page it is still available and we can delete it with a Reset button. For this, we must define a complex data structure (with arrays and objects) that is what we will store in the browser.
